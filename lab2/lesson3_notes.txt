From the URL: https://github.com/udacity/simple_arm/blob/master/README.md

I created a new robot from scratch using the following commands

  $ cd ~/catkin_ws 
  $ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=kinetic -y
  $ catkin_make
  $ source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash  gd
  $ roslaunch simple_arm robot_spawn.launch

The Gazebo simulator starts to swing the arm +/-pi after about 5 seconds after launch - but I am not sending the arm any command?   From the above URL - it shows how to publish cmds to the arm - but they have no effect - you can view the camera and see the arm swinging.. 

I can also echo topics and see no commands are being published
