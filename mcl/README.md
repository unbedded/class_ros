## What's MCL?
- Estimating the state of a dynamical system is a fundamental problem
- The Recursive Bayes Filter is an effective approach to estimate the belief about the state of a dynamical system
   - How to represent this belief? & How to maximize it?§
 - Particle filters are a way to efficiently represent an arbitrary (non-Gaussian) distribution
 - Basic principle
   - Set of state hypotheses (“particles”) ->Survival-of-the-fittest
